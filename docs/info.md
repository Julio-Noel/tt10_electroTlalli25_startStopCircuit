How it works
This circuit presents a solution for the start/stop with latch project used to activate/deactivate a load. The system is generated in two sections, a) combinational circuit, and b) sequential circuit.

How to test
Press the start button, for each solution to verify the load activation flag. As well, press the stop button, for each solution to verify the load deactivation flag.

External hardware
To verify the system, you must connect a pull-down set-button circuit to the IN0-IN1, and IN6-IN7, for each solution, respectively. Furthermore, x5 led circuits have to be connected to the OUT0, OUT1-OUT3, and OUT7 for the clock signal verification, sequential circuit solution verification, and combinational circuit solution verification, respectively. An Oscilloscope is needed to verify the clock signal.
